# blazersh

## Description
This is my first project in C. Blazersh is a simple shell interface written for Linux with functionality to satisfy the requirements of a course project. Completed for CS 433 Operating Systems at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Department of Computer Science. This projected has been graded and made public with permission.

The functionality of blazersh include I/O redirection, starting background processes, and pipes.

If I find the time, I will clean up the code. I know more now about C than when I began this project.
